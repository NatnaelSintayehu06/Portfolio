       <p class="sitereport-p">While doing this assignment, I has a lot of ups and downs. The ups were how easy I found making the ‘index.html’, adding features like images, creating the navigation bar and decorating it the way I wanted was simple enough. Creating the grid layout was also simple since I wanted it just be 1 column. This made it easier with the mobile version since it was already mobile friendly by using that grid. For the ‘project.html’, I found it easy to create the grid layout for each projects since all I had to do was use ‘div’ to separate each project and use ‘repeat’ in the css for the row, I also decorated the project page by adding borders around each project. When creating the mobile version of my website, I found it difficult to make the hamburger icon make the navigation appear. But at the end I figured out how to use the ‘:target’ and ‘id’ to make it appear and disappear while using the hamburger icon. Rearranging the contents on the mobile version was fairly easy considering for the project page all I had to do was reduce the text size on the ‘mobile.css’. I found creating the animation on ‘contact.html’ difficult since I didn’t know how to make the circle move, but after re-reading the slides I figured out how to and after that all I had to do was figure out the distance the ball has to move so it don’t go off screen. I have chosen the colour black, purple and white because it would stand out and make the website look interesting and also different. I have also decided to use links onto the social media icons so that anyone can contact me via social media accounts.</p>
